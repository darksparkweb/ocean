                  1. The ocean in a worldwide pandemic As the year that
                  challenged the world with a widespread pandemic draws to a
                  close, COVID-19 has affected almost every aspect of life as we
                  knew it. Even the ocean, the most powerful force in the world,
                  is not immune to its effects. The amount of marine plastic
                  pollution, 13 million tons of which was already entering the
                  ocean each year, has certainly grown with the addition of
                  improperly disposed personal protective equipment, such as
                  single-use masks and gloves. People are using an estimated 129
                  billion face masks and 65 billion gloves every month; one
                  report predicts that 1.56 billion face masks could end up in
                  the ocean this year. State and city rollbacks on bans of
                  plastic items like bags and utensils due to concern over
                  spreading the virus via reusable options could contribute as
                  well. The influx of yet more plastic to the sea not only poses
                  a threat to human health, but also heightens the risk of
                  injury or death to some 600 wildlife species that may consume
                  debris they mistake for food. On a brighter note, the early
                  days of the pandemic provided a rare opportunity to study a
                  quieter underwater habitat resulting from reduced worldwide
                  trade. Researchers examined underwater sound in real-time near
                  the port of Vancouver and found a consistent reduction in
                  low-frequency sound attributed to ship traffic from January to
                  April, when imports and exports dropped 20%. This study and
                  others are providing much-anticipated evidence about the
                  effect noise pollution has on marine life.

                  What is “ocean justice”? According to marine biologist Ayana
                  Elizabeth Johnson, it is the meeting place of ocean
                  conservation and social equity. It is hard to miss this ocean
                  warrior and scientist’s writing and voice, laying out how
                  action against climate change is slowed by racism. She also
                  co-edited a book on climate composed entirely of female
                  voices, released in 2020. Johnson is joined by a community of
                  Black marine scientists doing important research. This year,
                  multiple campaigns highlighted and celebrated Black
                  representation in many areas of science. One of them,
                  #BlackInMarineScienceWeek, founded by environmental ecologist
                  Tiara Moore, underscored a historically underrepresented
                  group’s contributions to the field and inspired younger
                  generations to pursue a career in marine science. Diverse
                  representation and the inclusion of gender, race and
                  socioeconomics in the conversation about the impacts of
                  climate change are critical: marginalized groups often bear a
                  greater burden of effects like flooding and pollution, while
                  groups with privilege and power often benefit more from
                  conservation initiatives. It is imperative for all members of
                  the marine science field to help ensure the progress and
                  recognition continues well beyond the week-long campaign.

                  The reach that COVID-19 has had in the ocean does not stop at
                  health factors; the pandemic has also disrupted the “blue
                  economy.” The ocean would be the world’s seventh-largest
                  economy if it were a nation, with marine jobs, services and
                  products valued at $2.5 trillion a year. Border closures and
                  diminished restaurant demand have drastically impacted the
                  seafood industry, with fishing activity declines of up to 80%
                  in China and West Africa. The U.S., one of the top seafood
                  exporters and importers, also experienced a 40% decline in
                  catches, along with similar declines in imports and exports.
                  Ocean-based tourism is an important contributor to the GPD of
                  many countries, with a global value of $390 billion before the
                  pandemic. Small island developing states that depend on
                  ocean-based tourism for foreign exchange have been
                  particularly vulnerable to the effects of halted travel, with
                  a potential global impact on tourism amounting to a loss of
                  $7.4 billion and risking 75 million jobs. Looking into the
                  post-COVID-19 future, there are opportunities for rebuilding a
                  stronger and more sustainable ocean economy. To find a balance
                  between using the world’s oceans and protecting them from
                  overexploitation, a panel of leaders from 14 nations convened
                  to develop a detailed set of goals that prioritize sustainable
                  seafood production, climate change, biodiversity loss,
                  economic recovery, and holistic ocean management,along with
                  science-backed plans for how the member nations can reach them
                  by 2025. The panel invites other nations to join, aiming for
                  100% of the ocean under national jurisdictions to be managed
                  sustainably as a new blue economy emerges by 2030.

                  Endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis)
                  continued to make headlines as their dwindling numbers drew
                  increasing concern from scientists. In October, the U.S.
                  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
                  released a new population estimate of just 366 individuals as
                  of January 2019, an 11% decrease from the year before. With
                  only around 94 reproductive females, the species has struggled
                  with reproduction while also experiencing high mortality from
                  collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear. New
                  technologies aim to help address the collisions and
                  entanglements. Ropeless fishing traps made progress this year.
                  These stow the ropes used to haul up the traps on the seafloor
                  until fishers release them with an acoustic signal. The ropes
                  currently extend from the trap to a buoy at the surface, and
                  they entangle many whales. A new “Right Whale Slow Zones”
                  campaign launched along the U.S. East Coast, where the whales
                  spend much of their time. It provides vessel operators with
                  information about where right whales have been detected. New
                  technology in southern California is also addressing ship
                  collisions with endangered whales. Our institution, the
                  Benioff Ocean Initiative, launched an online tool called Whale
                  Safe that draws on information from AI-powered ocean sensors,
                  big data models and direct whale sightings, the first time the
                  three data sources have been combined. The tool integrates the
                  data streams to detect endangered whales and disseminate
                  whale-presence data to mariners in near real-time. These
                  technological approaches to whale conservation offer scalable
                  and reproducible solutions for whale-ship collisions
                  worldwide.

                  After the U.N. Security Council passed sanctions on North
                  Korea in 2017, international fishing within North Korean
                  waters became illegal. A new study by Global Fishing Watch
                  revealed that in 2017 and 2018 Chinese “dark fleets” illegally
                  caught an estimated 160,000 tons of Pacific flying squid
                  (Todarodes pacificus) worth $440 million in North Korean
                  waters. The presence of hundreds of comparatively advanced
                  Chinese vessels has pushed some North Korean fishers to make
                  the dangerous journey in their wooden ships to fish illegally
                  in Russian waters, often with deadly results.To spot the
                  Chinese fleet, which was invisible to ordinary monitoring
                  methods because the vessels were not publicly broadcasting
                  their positions, the researchers used an innovative
                  combination of four satellite technologies, creating new
                  transparency in fishery management. In another bid for
                  transparent fisheries, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
                  Commission (IATTC) has moved toward real-time electronic
                  monitoring of fishing activities aboard vessels that operate
                  in its jurisdiction in the eastern Pacific. Tuna fisheries
                  there, worth $5.1 billion in 2018, are subject to illegal
                  fishing and overexploitation, and as a deterrent the IATTC
                  requires fishing vessels to carry human monitors to record
                  their activities. Due to the pandemic, however, the IATTC and
                  other regional fisheries management organizations have
                  modified those requirements, underscoring the need to
                  transition to electronic monitoring systems. Advocates are
                  calling for the IATTC to ensure comprehensive implementation.

                  Although a lot of science was done from home this year, some
                  researchers were still able to get out in the field, and their
                  discoveries made global headlines. Using the Schmidt Ocean
                  Institute’s underwater ROV SuBastian in the waters off western
                  Australia, researchers discovered both the longest animal ever
                  recorded, a 46-meter (150-foot) siphonophore, and a coral reef
                  taller than the Empire State Building. These discoveries, in
                  an area as well known as the Great Barrier Reef, reveal how
                  little we still know about the deep ocean. Even when new
                  species are discovered it can take years for scientists to
                  describe and classify them, as was the case with a deep-sea
                  comb jelly that NOAA discovered in 2015 but only formally
                  described this year. Deep-sea scientists are on a mission to
                  change this, and recently announced plans for a decade-long
                  research program called Challenger 150. The deep sea, which
                  officially begins 200 meters (656 feet) below the surface, may
                  soon be opened up to more than just research. Regulations to
                  allow mining of the seafloor could be finalized in 2021. At
                  least 10 NGOs, including Greenpeace, and three Pacific Island
                  states have expressed concern, and David Attenborough is among
                  those who have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining.
